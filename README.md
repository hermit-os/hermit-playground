# HermitCore-rs - A Rust-based, lightweight unikernel for a scalable and predictable runtime behavior

[![Build Status](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/acs/public/hermitcore/hermit-playground/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/acs/public/hermitcore/hermit-playground/pipelines)
[![Slack Status](https://matrix.osbyexample.com:3008/badge.svg)](https://matrix.osbyexample.com:3008)

[HermitCore]( http://www.hermitcore.org ) is a new
[unikernel](http://unikernel.org) targeting a scalable and predictable runtime
for high-performance and cloud computing.
We decided to develop a new version of the kernel in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) .
We promise that this will make it easier to maintain and extend our kernel.
All code beside the kernel can still be developed in your preferred language (C/C++/Go/Fortran).
If you want to develope pure Rust applications, please look into [RustyHermit](https://github.com/hermitcore/libhermit-rs).

This repository contains the Rust-based playground for C/C++/Go/Fortran applications.
Currently, it isn't stable and does not support all features of the [C-based version](https://github.com/hermitcore/libhermit) and runs only in our own hypervisor.

## Requirements

The build process works currently only on **x86-based Linux** systems. To build
the HermitCore-rs kernel and applications you need:

 * CMake
 * Recent host compiler such as GCC
 * HermitCore cross-toolchain, i.e. Binutils, GCC, newlib, pthreads
 * [Rust compiler (nightly release)](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)
 * Rust source code for cross-compiling, which can be installed with `rustup component add rust-src`.

### HermitCore-rs cross-toolchain

We provide a Docker container with all required tools to build HermitCore-rs applications.

To test the toolchain, create a simple C program (e.g. `hello world`) and name the file `main.c`.
Use following command to build the applications:

```bash
$ docker run -v $PWD:/volume -w /volume --rm -t ghcr.io/hermitcore/hermit-toolchain:latest x86_64-hermit-gcc -o main main.c
```

The command mounts the current directory as working directory into a docker container and runs the cross-compiler to build the application.
Afterwards, you will find the executable `main` in your current directory.

If you want to build the toolchain yourself, have a look at the `path2rs` branch of the repository
[hermit-toolchain](https://github.com/hermitcore/hermit-toolchain).
It contains scripts to build the whole toolchain for HermitCore-rs.

## Building

### Preliminary work

As a first step, the repository and its submodules have to be cloned:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:hermitcore/hermit-playground.git
$ cd hermit-playground
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

### Building the library operating systems and its examples

To build the Rust-based kernel and its examples, go to the directory with the source code
and issue the following commands:

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

If your toolchain is not located in `/opt/hermit/bin` then you have to supply
its location to the `cmake` command above like so:

```bash
$ cmake -DTOOLCHAIN_BIN_DIR=/home/user/hermit/bin ..
```

Assuming that binaries like `x86_64-hermit-gcc` and friends are located in that
directory.
To install your new version in the same directory, you have to set the installation path and install HermitCore-rs as follows:

```bash
$ cmake -DTOOLCHAIN_BIN_DIR=/home/user/hermit/bin -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/user/hermit ..
$ make
$ make install
```

**Note:** If you use the cross compiler outside of this repository, it uses the library operating system located
by the toolchain (e.g. `/opt/hermit/x86_64-hermit/lib/libhermit.a`).

## Uhyve - A lightweight hypervisor

Part of HermitCore is a small hypervisor, which is called *uhyve*.
This tool helps to start HermitCore applications within a KVM-accelerated virtual machine.
In principle it is a bridge to the Linux system.
If the uyhve is registered as loader to the Linux system, HermitCore applications can be started like common Linux applications.
*uhyve* can be registered with the following command:

```bash
$ sudo -c sh 'echo ":hermit:M:7:\\x42::/opt/hermit/bin/uhyve:" > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register'
```

Applications can then be directly called like:
```bash
$ /opt/hermit/x86_64-hermit/extra/tests/hello
```

Otherwise, *uhyve* must be started directly and needs the path to the HermitCore application as an argument:
```bash
$ /opt/hermit/bin/uhyve /opt/hermit/x86_64-hermit/extra/tests/hello
```

Afterwards, the *uhyve* starts the HermitCore application within a VM.

## Testing

HermitCore applications can be directly started as a standalone kernel within a
virtual machine:

```bash
$ cd build
$ make install DESTDIR=~/hermit-build
$ cd ~/hermit-build/opt/hermit
$ bin/uhyve x86_64-hermit/extra/tests/hello
```

The application will be started within our thin
hypervisor powered by Linux's KVM API and therefore requires *KVM* support.
In principle, it is an extension of [ukvm](https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/conference/protected-files/hotcloud16_slides_williams.pdf).

The environment variable `HERMIT_CPUS` specifies the number of
CPUs (and no longer a range of core ids). Furthermore, the variable `HERMIT_MEM`
defines the memory size of the virtual machine. The suffixes *M* and *G* can be
used to specify a value in megabytes or gigabytes respectively. By default, the
loader initializes a system with one core and 2 GiB RAM.
For instance, the following command starts the stream benchmark in a virtual machine, which
has 4 cores and 6GB memory:

```bash
$ HERMIT_CPUS=4 HERMIT_MEM=6G bin/uhyve x86_64-hermit/extra/benchmarks/stream
```

To enable an Ethernet device for `uhyve`, we have to setup a tap device on the
host system. For instance, the following command establishes the tap device
`tap100` on Linux:

```bash
$ sudo ip tuntap add tap100 mode tap
$ sudo ip addr add 10.0.5.1/24 broadcast 10.0.5.255 dev tap100
$ sudo ip link set dev tap100 up
$ sudo bash -c 'echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/tap100/proxy_arp'
```

By default, `uhyve`'s network interface uses `10.0.5.2`as IP address, `10.0.5.1`
for the gateway and `255.255.255.0` as network mask.
The default configuration can be overwritten by the environment variables
`HERMIT_IP`, `HERMIT_GATEWAY` and `HERMIT_MASk`.
To enable the device, `HERMIT_NETIF` must be set to the name of the tap device.
For instance, the following command starts an HermitCore application within `uhyve`
and enables the network support:

```bash
$ HERMIT_IP="10.0.5.3" HERMIT_GATEWAY="10.0.5.1" HERMIT_MASK="255.255.255.0" HERMIT_NETIF=tap100 bin/uhyve x86_64-hermit/extra/tests/hello
```

## Building your own HermitCore applications

You can take `usr/tests` as a starting point to build your own applications. All
that is required is that you include
`[...]/HermitCore/cmake/HermitCore-Application.cmake` in the first line of your application's
`CMakeLists.txt`. It doesn't have to reside inside the HermitCore repository.
Other than that, it should behave like normal CMake.

## Tips

### Dumping the kernel log

By setting the environment variable `HERMIT_VERBOSE` to `1`, *uhyve* prints
the kernel log messages to the screen at termination.

## Missing features
(might be comming)
* Multikernel support
* Running baremetal/without hypervisor
